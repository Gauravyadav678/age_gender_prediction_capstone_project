  how to run the given code
 1. firstly you need to set  a environment of python language on any platform(like, jupyter, pycharme)
 2. we need to import some library like opencv etc.
 3. after this we will have to find the face. i use the cascadeclassifier in my model to detect the face.
 4. now we need to trained our model for age and gender classification by using the caffemodel
 5.now our model is trained ,so pass the input like webcam or any live video .I used you tube video in mymodel for age gender pridiction.
 6. and I also upload some screenshots of my executed code(predicted model).
